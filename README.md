Facial Emotion Detection
This project aims to detect facial emotions using Python and OpenCV along with other essential libraries. The model is built to analyze facial expressions in real-time and categorize emotions, utilizing libraries such as OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, and MediaPipe.
Introduction
This project detects facial emotions from images or video streams, allowing for real-time analysis. It uses pre-trained models and leverages MediaPipe for face landmark detection, OpenCV for video capture and image processing, and NumPy for data handling.

Features
Detects and classifies emotions from facial expressions in real-time
Uses a combination of machine learning and image processing techniques
Interactive user interface for real-time analysis
Requirements
This project requires Python 3 and the following libraries:

OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
MediaPipe
Project Structure
The project contains three primary components:

data_collection: Scripts and modules for collecting training data
data_training: Contains code and models for training emotion detection models
interface: The main interface for running real-time emotion detection
